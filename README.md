# README

This is part of the Member's Only project in The Odin Project's Ruby of Rails curriculum. Found here: http://www.theodinproject.com

The purpose of this project is to gain experience building a user based application using the Devise gem. To do this I am creating an application where users can create, edit, and destroy posts while non-users can only view the post index and the individual posts. Additionally a signed-in user can see who authored the post while a non-user cannot.
